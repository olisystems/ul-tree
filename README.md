## Description

Building a tree view for the hierarchical data is a common task in the front-end development of web applications. In most cases, hierarchical data is available in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) which is a lightweight data format, and we need to represent this data as a tree on the webpage. In this tutorial, we will walk through the steps to dynamically create a nested list from the JSON data and style it to a vertically oriented tree view. The tutorial will use jQuery expression evaluation statement, Flexbox layout, and Pseudo-classes and Pseudo-elements from CSS3.
